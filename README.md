# Reflex Issue Tracker

Welcome here! This repository is created with two reasons:

1. Developers can easily maintain Reflex related issues.
2. People can see Reflex progress and avoid creating repetitive issues all the time.


Before getting started, please [read this article](https://goo.gl/Sjdqvb)!

To **report an issue**, [click here](http://go.reflex.rip/bug "Click this label to open the Issue Tracker itself"), then find and push the **New Issue** button, fill all the fields you see in a template, and then click the **Submit new issue** button.


You can also ask questions here, if you have any.
