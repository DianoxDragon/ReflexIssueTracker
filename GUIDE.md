## Welcome here!
### This article will guide you through this issue tracker and will teach you how to report an issue, suggest a feature or ask a question  easily and efficiently. Moreover, this article is **required** to read before posting your first issue.




## General
When creating a new issue, a pre-filled text field can be noticed. Please do not erase anything in it unless you are asking a very simply question or suggesting a very simple and small feature.


Let's start filling everything.


All the data should be written near the "＞" symbol. 
First off, you need to know what are you reporting. That is either a **bypass** (if you can hack without getting detected), a **false positive** (if you're getting kicked for hacking while playing legitimately), a **console error** (Reflex-related errors (stacktraces) in your server console), a **bug** (some other form of unexpected plugin behavior), a **question** (Reflex-related question which has no answer in the FAQ of the plugin) or a **feature request** (if you want us to add or change something in Reflex). 

Write your issue type near the "＞" symbol under "ISSUE TYPE" title like here:
